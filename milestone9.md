**Milestone 9**

Karthik Komatineni - Worked on the seeker page by presenting pins of where the ghost is hiding. Also revised the features and how the ghost and seeker interacted. The seeker will find where the ghost was instead of a direct path.


Danny Dang - Began to work on the UI and added temporary placeholders throughout the app. 


Robert Ferng - Also worked on the UI and worked on how the rate page should look.


Hon Lao - Helped worked on the javascript with Karthik. Revised and made it easier to read and cleared up useless code.

Initially, we had a line which the seeker can follow. The problem with that is that it isn't very engaging. These are the multiple areas where the ghost has been. We randomly pick a few areas where the ghost had been for the seeker to go to and search for the ghost.
