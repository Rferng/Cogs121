These first images represent the landing page of the game. To find a match, one just needs to decide whether or not they want to be the ghost or seeker. They can also create either a public or private map, one to play with friends or anybody. The settings can be set before the game room is created. The settings consist of game time, game proximity, delay in steps, number of pins, and the ability to choose which abilities present in each game. To create a game room, the user can just press either the ghost or seeker icons.

This shows one variation of the game screen and how the game should play out. This is a recording of how the game works. The user starts at one location and the pins is the path that the person takes. It shows the environment the players are in. There is also a pop up when the game ends whether or not if the ghost was caught or not.

The seeking player gets their own screen and a map. THe map shows the steps the ghost has taken and when the seeker gets close to the ghost, there is a circle proximity that pops up. The seeker is shown time remaining, pins to drop, and a chance to quit if they no longer want to participate.

The Ghost screen is simple as it only has the time and how close the seeker is to the ghost.
