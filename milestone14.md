Karthik Komatineni - Added a waiting page for the hider. The hider page gives a timer that countsdown to let the ghost know whether they should keep waiting for the seeker or finish the game. This also signifies whether or not they won. It also serves as a check to see if the seeker player the game or not. Also added instructional modals to the seeker and hider pages. 

Danny Dang - Went through and realigned elements of most pages. Changed how page elements were displayed to promote user clarity and prevent user error. Revamped the text for most of the app by making them more clear. Created the instructions that exists on the new modals on the hider and seeker pages. Made sire that elements display properly on both mobile and desktop versions of the app.
