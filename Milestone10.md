- What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.

Ghost tag is an intuitive interactive experience that allows users to play hide and seek that uses live gps geolocation to record and display
possible hiding locations of the hider to the seeker.

- How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practices?

Today geolocation games are rarely used in a interactive game sense, the most notiable being pokemon go. The game of hide and seek has
not been successfully implemented in current practices so we feel that we bring a fresh new experienece to each individual user.

- What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?

Our app allows users to interact both with other players and the enviornment around them. Though the game is mainly use for friends to
enjoy their time together, it also allows for players to explore the enviornments they've most likely never been in before. Allowing
for a fresh new experienece or both hiders and seekers.

- Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?

Our app targets active and adventurous individual, but we design it in a way that is accessible to all users. Anyone willing to go
outside will be able to enjoy our app. Though our app fails to solve large world problems, our main goal  is to get each user just a little
more active and hopefully they will experience new enviornments and gain enjoyment in exploration.
